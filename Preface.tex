\chapter{Preface}
\Large EIE 341 is the experiment class of EIE 340 Analog Circuit.\par

\section{Purpose}

The purpose of studying experiment classes is to help us have a
better understanding of what we learn in the class when it comes to practical application in real life.\par

Additionally, the experiments encourage us to observe and discuss any differences between theoretical prediction and actual outcomes while we are required to conduct experiments. This process helps us develop critical thinking skills after we have found the discrepancies.\par

Last but not least, conducting experiment helps us have better understanding of what we had been taught in the class.
